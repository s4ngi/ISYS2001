        "Apply a structured problem-solving methodology to design and implement a User Preferences program. In this activity, you will practise computational thinking by breaking down the problem into manageable steps—from planning and pseudocode to coding your final solution—and learn how to use AI tools to support your process.\n",
        "\n",
        "> **Note:** In this activity, we are focusing on the workflow and process of solving a problem, rather than the problem itself. While the tasks in this notebook are similar to those in Activity 2, the structured methodology presented here is designed to help you observe how a systematic approach can streamline your coding process. Reflect on how the two approaches differ in terms of planning, execution, and problem-solving, and consider which aspects of each workflow can be applied to your future projects."
